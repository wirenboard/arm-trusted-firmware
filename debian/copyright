This package was debianized by Adam Borowski <kilobyte@angband.pl> on

It can be downloaded from https://github.com/anarsoul/arm-trusted-firmware
and is overall distributable as "GPL-2 or later".

This software is based on ARM Trusted Foundation, BSD-3 licensed:
Copyright (c) 2013-2014, ARM Limited and Contributors. All rights reserved.
(certain files come from {Net,Free}BSD or Berkeley, see below)

The code has been then forked by Allwinner Technology Co., Ltd., and
providen as "Lichee BSP", part of "Allwinner Software Release" (the tarball
seems to be no longer publicly available), labelled as GPL with no detailed
licensing or file history.  The diff from vanilla ATF:
https://github.com/apritzel/arm-trusted-firmware/commit/90fc243e9256775c85f8763e8fa1b2b59e67d0ce
shows it's a mix of BSD-3 code by ARM Ltd (with license headers; presumably
cherry-picked from other versions of the ATF) and GPL2+ code by Allwinner,
the latter with spotty licensing data but obviously written in-house by
Allwinner's employees, of which only Jerry Wang <wangflord@allwinnertech.com>
and superm (superm@allwinnertech.com) are named in person.

It has then been maintained by:
