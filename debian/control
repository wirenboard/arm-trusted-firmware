Description: "secure world" software for ARM SoCs
 The "secure world" on arm64 machines is a special level of CPU
 privilege that is hidden from the normal OS, and has complete
 control over the system.  It provides both initialization during
 early boot stages (before u-boot or EFI) and system monitor
 functionality once the machine is booted up.  This is an equivalent
 of Intel ME on x86.
